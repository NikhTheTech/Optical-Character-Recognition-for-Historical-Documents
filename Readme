# Optical Character Recognition for Historical Documents

An end-to-end OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system built using Python, OpenCV, Tesseract, and Tkinter, designed specifically for processing and translating historical documents. This project allows users to:

✅ Upload scanned images or PDFs of historical texts
✅ Preprocess images (denoising, contrast enhancement, sharpening, deskewing) for improved OCR accuracy
✅ Extract text using Tesseract OCR (supports multiple languages)
✅ Automatically detect language of the extracted text
✅ Translate text into English (or other target languages)
✅ Export results as PDF or Word (.docx) files
✅ Use an interactive GUI with light/dark mode support

## Features

Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline

Noise detection and removal

Contrast enhancement

Image sharpening

Automatic deskewing

Adaptive thresholding for better binarization

Multi-language OCR

Supports English, French, Spanish, and German (can be extended easily)

Uses pytesseract with custom OCR configuration for accuracy

Automatic Language Detection & Translation

Detects the source language using langdetect

Translates non-English text to English using deep-translator

Export Options

Save results as PDF (auto-incrementing filenames)

Save results as Word document

User-Friendly GUI

Built with Tkinter

Upload images with a single click

View OCR output and translated output in pop-up windows

Toggle dark mode for better readability
